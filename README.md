## Introduction
The [**Abelian sandpile model**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abelian_sandpile_model), also known as the **Bak–Tang–Wiesenfeld model** is a cellular automaton. In its original formulation, each site on a finite grid has an associated value that corresponds to the slope of the pile. This slope builds up as "grains of sand" (or "chips") are randomly placed onto the pile, until the slope exceeds a specific threshold value at which time that site collapses transferring sand into the adjacent sites, increasing their slope. 


## How to run

### Qt Creator
Start by installing the Qt5 SDK from (qt.io)[https://www.qt.io/download]. 
To build this projects, open the project.pro file with Qt Creator. Inside Qt Creator, you can first build the project, after which you can run the program.
